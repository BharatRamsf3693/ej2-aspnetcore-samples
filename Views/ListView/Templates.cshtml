+ "full.</p><p>Q: Regarding the free license for companies with 5 developers or less than $1m"
+ "in annual revenue: when does that license expire?</p><p>A: The Community License has"
+ "several criteria that make it distinct from the global license, so there is no single"
+ "answer to that question. Any customers with questions about the Community License should"
+ "contact a Syncfusion sales representative.</p><p>Q: Our business line in health care"
+ "requires that we obtain business agreements with contractors and vendors. Has Syncfusion"
+ "signed these kinds of BAs in the past?</p><p>A: We work with many companies that request"
+ "such documents, and we can always put you in touch with our legal team for"

+ "to buy the Dashboard Server or is it royalty-free?</p><p>A: Please contact"

+ "single answer.</p><p>Q: Is there a time limit?</p><p>A: Our license model reflects a 1-year"
+ "term unless you make other arrangements during the sales process.</p><p>Q: Can I use my"
+ "global license to create software that has Syncfusion controls embedded within it and sell"
+ "this software to my clients, or does that require a reseller or runtime license?</p><p>A:"
+ "If you are providing an end-product to your client, and additional coding will not be"
+ "needed, you may sell your software to your client with just the global license. If the"
+ "software requires additional work over time, you will need to speak with your Syncfusion"
+ "sales representative to ensure you have the correct license.</p><p>Q: When does my license"

+ "clientrelations@syncfusion.com for more information on consulting if you are"
+ "interested.</p><p>Q:  I have contractors that do my development. Are they covered by the"
+ "global license?</p><p>A:  They can be! The flat license structure (project, division, and"
+ "global) is designed for use by third-party contractors. If that is requested and agreed"
+ "upon, we will include that information in your Master License Agreement.</p><p>Q:  What is"
+ "the benefit of including all my users in the portal?</p><p>A:  Developers can see support"
+ "incidents created within the portal and can receive patches and updates so users are all"
+ "working on the same version of Syncfusion. Our client relations team also monitors accounts"
+ "to ensure that you do not have an excessive amount of support incidents open at one time."

+ "to be notified when a user needs to be added.</p><p>Q:  Why would I want to create a new"
+ "portal each time I start a new project?</p><p>A:  Not only is this a great organizational"
+ "feature that keeps your projects autonomous from one another, each portal can support a"

+ "co-dependency here.</p><p>Q:   Do I have to assign a platform or component to each project?"
+ "What if I have multiple components being used on one project?</p><p>A:  The only time"
+ "Syncfusion will ask you to associate a platform or component with a project is during"
+ "incident creation. You can use multiple controls or components on one project, but only if"

                + "Application Security in .NET Succinctly was published on Tuesday, October 12. You can download the book"
+ "here.</p><p>What should people know about application security in the .NET Framework? Why is it important?"
+ "</p><p>Microsoft’s .NET Framework ushered a new era of rapid application development that was almost as powerful as"
+ "C/C++ development on one hand, but did not have as many sharp edges and opportunities to \"shoot yourself in the"
+ "foot\" on the other hand. The unfortunate side effect was that .NET developers\" efforts were mostly spent"
+ "discovering and calling the APIs provided by the .NET ecosystem, not learning how to use these APIs correctly. Many"
+ "of the .NET security-related APIs are not safe to use by a casual .NET developer. This book tries to raise"
+ "awareness of many important application security topics that most .NET developers are bound to run into.</p><p>The"
+ "importance of understanding the challenges and pitfalls of application security is hard to underestimate. The"
+ "security breaches are happening weekly if not daily, and their scope and magnitude continue to grow as users"
+ "entrust (or are forced to entrust) more of their information to digital repositories and their"
+ "operators.</p><p>When did you first become interested in application security?</p><p>I became interested in"
+ "application security through a fascination with cryptography when I was 15 years old. I wrote an \"unbreakable\""
+ "XOR-based encryption mechanism in Turbo Pascal that I was very proud of. As laughable as it is now, I\"m sure many"
+ "folks in the security field have a similar story to share. The writings of Bruce Schneier fueled my interest and"
+ "made me realize that the information security domain is too focused on cryptographic tools and primitives, and not"
+ "focused enough on how to use these tools to engineer secure systems.</p><p>By writing this e-book, did you learn"
+ "anything new yourself?</p><p>I learned that application security and security in general are difficult topics to"
+ "write about. Unlike basic things like math or computer science, application security is a rapidly moving and"
+ "evolving field, with new threats, vulnerabilities, exploits, and countermeasures arriving nonstop. The prescriptive"
+ "\"do X, Y, and Z to be safe\" approach to security might work today, but is inadequate tomorrow. Rather than \"giving"
+ "readers a fish,\" I’ve tried to \"teach them how to fish\" in hopes that a foundational understanding of core concepts"
+ "will provide longer-term value.</p><p>How will application security change over the next few years?</p><p>I think"
+ "the security field has come to a threshold where it will start to be regulated. The amount of incompetence and"
+ "negligence in this field is only matched by the magnitude of damages, and that creates a lethal combination that"
+ "everyone in our digital economy suffers from. We already regulate doctors, lawyers, pilots, and many other"
+ "professions, as well as organizations employing them.</p><p>I think that the regulatory changes will affect not"
+ "only the technical in-the-field professionals, but will also impact the C-suite, and force senior leadership to"
+ "give security pros a seat at the table. One of the highlights of this profound lack of senior-level understanding"
+ "was in the Equifax Personnel-Change statement that followed the recent massive Equifax data breach. Equifax"
+ "appointed a new Chief Security Officer (CSO), and made the CSO report to the CIO. When the just-been-breached"
+ "Equifax does not understand why the CSO must report to the CEO and not the CIO, that\"s another sign that executive"
+ "leadership still does not have the right perspective on security.</p><p>Another industry-wide change in perspective"
+ "that I’m anticipating is a shift from “defend the castle” to “inmates are running the asylum.” Insider threats are"
+ "already among the main security threats of 2017, and yet most security efforts are still just building"
+ "walls.</p><p>Do you see the application security as part of a larger trend in software development?</p><p>I believe"
+ "that thinking of application security as a larger trend in software development is like thinking of mathematics as"
+ "a larger trend in physics, or thinking of backups as a larger trend in disaster recovery. Not everyone must be a"
+ "highly skilled application-security professional, just like not everyone must be a highly-skilled accountant,"
+ "lawyer, or engineer. Yet most IT companies rely on professional services of a relatively small number of skilled"
+ "experts with unique domains of expertise. As software continues to \"eat the world,\" software development as a field"
+ "has long been vast enough and important enough to warrant domain specializations. Boeing does not advertise"
+ "\"full-stack aerospace engineer\" positions, and yet one of the core \"career areas\" for Boeing is \"cybersecurity.\""
+ "Ten years ago, every company became a software company. In 2017, every software company must become a"
+ "cybersecurity-focused company. Cybersecurity begins in the C-suite.</p><p>What other books or resources on"
+ "application security do you recommend?</p><p>Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle book is a good read for"
+ "software development managers and architects. Those interested in the foundations of cryptography may find Crypto"
+ "101 or the Serious Cryptography book suitable. Those interested in the fundamentals of TLS, the largest application"
+ "of cryptography to the web, should check out Bulletproof SSL and TLS. Tangled Web is another favorite of mine,"
+ "which covers the insanity of the modern web.</p>"
